# C4E5
C4E5 is a [UCI](http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html) compatible Chess Engine based on the move generator [DragontoothMG](https://github.com/dylhunn/dragontoothmg).

The evaluation function is quite simple; it will eventually be replaced by a more sophisticated function based on Reinforcement Learning.

While C4E5 should run with every UCI compatible chess GUI, it was only tested on [ChessX](https://chessx.sourceforge.io/) and [JerryFX](https://asdfjkl.github.io/jerry/).
